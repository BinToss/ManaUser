Mini-Mods by ManaUser

This is a collection of simple mods I made mostly for my own use. Many
of them didn't seem quite worth releasing by themselves, so I packaged
them together. Most but not all could be considered "tweaks", but the
only thing they really have in common, is that they're fairly small,
esp-only mods.

Here's a short description of each. (Trib) (BM) (Both) and (Either)
after a mod indicate which expansion(s) it requires.

Ahnassi.esp
Lets players take the Ahnassi romance a little farther. Nothing too
explicit. One new quest, complete with Khajiity dialog.

Barb Fix.esp
Adjusts the skills of Barbarian equipped fur or netch leather so that
they will actually wear it.

Big Women.esp
Makes women of some races look a little a little stronger. Namely
Orcs, Redgaurds, Nords, Imperials and High Elves. Purely aesthetic.
The first four because they're supposed to be tough races, the last
because they look ridiculously thin.

Dark Sister.esp (Trib)
Despite the name, the Dark Brotherhood has always had both male and 
female members in other TES games, now they do in Morrowind too.
* New

DB Armor Reducer.esp (Trib)
Takes that expensive armor away from the lower level Dark Brotherhood
assassins. Mid level assassins have partial suits. It made no sense
for a level 1 character to have that kind of gear, and it was
unbalancing for the PC to get it at that level too.
* Now compatible with Dark Sisters.

Demon Weapons.esp
Changes Demon, Devil, and Fiend weapons to Cast on Strike, and gives 
Devil and Fiend varients more useful secondary effects. The latter 
change applies to the helms as well.
* New

Detect Gold.esp
Makes the Detect Key spell effect detect gold too. It's a little buggy
where gold in containers is concerned. The spell will still detects
gold after it has been removed. Kind of experimental.

Disease.esp
Adds some new diseases and makes some types of healthy creatures
(namely cliff racers) less likely to attack.

Grave Goods.esp
Makes urns in tombs more interesting. You can now find the odd bit of
jewelry, or other items from time to time, plus a chance of more
interesting "dusts" instead of bonemeal.

Healing.esp
Healers now live up to their name and can heal you directly instead of
just selling potions. Some healers offer a bigger selection of healing
spells than others, based on their experience level.
UPDATE: Healers can run out of magicka, but also might give you charity
healing if you're in desperate need and can't afford it.

Hide The Skooma.esp
This mod makes your character automatically "hide" their drugs when
talking to honest traders. That way you can still sell other items
without having to drop your contraband. Also traders in criminal
factions now have no qualms about buying them.

Hot Floor.esp (Either)
Hot floors in Dwemer ruins can burn you. Boots offer some protection, 
metal (heavy) help some, but light or medium boots are better.
* New

Index Mod.esp (BM)
This is intended to make Propylons more practical while preserving 
their oringal function. To that end, each index can be find somewhere
in its associated fortress, a few extra copies exist elsewhere, and
they can be detected as magic items.
* New

It's me, you idiot.esp
Gets rid of that darn "Who's there?" greeting. I never saw the point
of that, and 9 times out of 10 it shows up inappropriately anyway.

Khajiit Eyes.esp
This changes the Khajiits' Eye of Night spell into an always-on ability.
If you have an existing Khajiit character, use this console command:
Player->AddSpell Eye_of_Night

Mixed Guards 2.esp (Both)
It always seemed odd that some of the unique NPC guards were female,
but none of the rank-and-file (except Redoran guards) were. This mod
makes some of the generic guards women. This version uses static
replacements instead of leveled lists, which caused too many problems.
NOTE: This is not a sexy guards mod. All guards have sensible armor.

Mortal Guards.esp (Both)
Simply removes the respawn flag from guards.
Compatible with Mixed Guards 2.

Pelagiad Fix.esp
Pelagiad was one of the first areas Bethesda built, which I suspect is
why they goofed. Ever seen part of the fort DISAPEAR? That's because
it's technically "in" a cell one over from where it appears. This mod
fixes that.

Propylon Mod.esp
Changes the Propylons so you can make a complete loop by picking the 
right(or left) Propylon repeatedly. (Assuming you have every index.)

Re-Ouch (Either)
Tweaks to the "Ouch" scripts on Keening, Sunder and jury-rigged 
Wraithguard. It should be at once more forgiving and more relentless. 
It won't instantly kill you like I could before, but anyone fool 
enough to persist in misusing one of the Tools will find the damage 
quickly becomes overwhelming.

Riekling Knock Off.esp (BM)
(Based on Unboarable Rieklings by Neoptolemus)
This is a fun little mod that makes reikling raiders and their boars
work more like two creatures. They can be killed separately and if
you hit them hard enough the rieklink may be knocked off.

Show Ammo Dmg.esp (Both)
The game doesn't show the damage rating of arrows and bolts, but they
have one. It's added to bow's damage when you hit. I've renamed all
the arrows and bolts with their damage rating after their name.
Example: Glass Arrow 1-6, Iron Bolt 2-3

Show Ammo Dmg - NoExp.esp
As above but only does arrows and bold from the original game.

Silver Weapon Crate Fix.esp
You know that crate with exactly one of each silver weapon in it? I 
always suspected it was a testing object that accidentally got placed
in the game world or something. Anyway, it looks out of place to me.
This turns it into a more normal weapon crate. The new create usually 
includes a magic weapon though, just to be a little interesting.

Sleep.esp
Replaces the standard Sleep spell with one that works better. It's
totally legit (cost based on spell effects) but costs less than the
original. It may be harder to cast though, as it's multi-school
Destruction/Restoration now.

Sol-Weather Tweak.esp (BM)
Previously southern Solstheim had snow on the ground texture, but it
never actually snowed. Now there's a 15% chance.

Stolen Goods Fix.esp (Both)
(Previously this was partly broken, now fixed.)
Allows you to freely collect "stolen" items from the evidence chest
after you pay your fine or leave jail. But don't think this is a good
way to get a discount, because it also doubles fine for theft to twice
the value of the item. Morrowind's handling of stolen items is so
broken that this was the best solution I could come up with.

Stolen Goods Fix - No Exp.esp
As above but doesn't change the chests at For Frostmoth or the Royal
Palace in Mournhold.

Suran Ferry.esp (Either)
Adds a boatman west of Suran. He can take you either way across the
river or drop you off at Suran. Also fixes two minor problems on the
north dock. A barrel that was "levitating", and a step that was too
high to get up without jumping.
Update: Now works as expected with PTE

Tome of Spellmaking.esp
This puts a Tome of Spellmaking in each Mage's Guild. It works like
an NPC spellmaker except it costs magicka instead of gold. If you're
Telvanni, look for a surprise in your stronghold.

Turn Undead.esp (Both)
Makes Turn Undead significantly more powerful. It can actually destroy 
undead creatures if the magnitude is great enough. On the other hand, 
they're no immune to calm and demoralize effects.
* New
