                           MORROWIND: 
                         New Icons 2.1

Requires: Morrowind
	   		
*****************************************************************

I never liked the spell icons in Morrowind. They're pretty, but
most of them don't look like anything particular. I suppose I
would have learned to recognize them eventually, but I but I
decided to make my own instead. This may not be as pretty, but
they all have at least some connection with spell effect. I
figure even if it's not obvious what they mean the first time
you see them, you'll have not trouble remembering next time.

     1. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

Unzip all files into your Morrowind data files directory
c:\program files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files
by default). Be sure your unzip program leaves the directories
intact, so the icons end up in the Data Files\Icons\S\New_Icons
folder.

There are four esp files:
New Icons - Basic.esp       - The main esp.
New Icons - Trib Add-on.esp - Use this also if you have Tribunal.
New Icons - BM Add-on.esp   - Use this also if you have Bloodmoon.
New Icons - WGI Compat.esp  - Use instead of New Icons - Basic.esp
                              if you have Wakim's Game Improvements.
                              Make sure it's loaded after WGI.

Any esp files you won't be using can be deleted.

To load the mod, start Morrowind, and when the launcher window
comes up, click "Data Files," then find	each esp file that you
will be using and double click it. Click Ok, then, back at the
Morrowind Launcher, click Play.

     2. PLAYING THE PLUGIN

There's nothing to it, just start playing and enjoy the new.
clearer icons. Also note that Mysticism is now Midnight Blue so
it looks less like Alteration. Most should be self explanitory
but just in case, here's a list of the icons, what they mean,
and when it's not obvious, and why they mean it. You needn't
read this unless you have trouble remembering them.
