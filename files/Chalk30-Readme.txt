     2. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

To install the plugin, unzip the files into the 
Morrowind/Data Files directory. Be sure to keep the directory
structure intact. From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files
and check the box next to Chalk30-Base.esp, and if you want to
add glowing chalk, put a check by  Chalk30-Glow.esp as well.

                        FINDING CHALK

Where to find chalk: Chalk can be found at a Trader or Pawnbroker
in most towns on Vvardenfal (not Mournhold or Solstheim). You
can also find it in random junk crates such as in bandit caves.
Red chalk is a little rarer but found in the same places.

Glowing chalk if harder to find, but (assuming you loadded the
optional glow plugin) in some enchanters' shops, and other random
places.

                         USING CHALK

-----------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: If you read all this it's probably going to sound alot 
more complicated than it really is. Feel free to read Basic Usage 
and skip the rest for now. For your convenience, these same 
instructions are available in-game as a scroll by equipping a
stick of chalk and clicking Help.
-----------------------------------------------------------------


                         Basic Usage

It's as easy as one, two, three. 1. Drop the chalk on a flat 
surface like the floor or a crate. 2. Select from one of the 
categories, like "Symbols" or "Inventory". 3. Select the specific 
mark you want, such as "Arrow" or "Junk".


                       Adjusting Marks

If after making a chalk mark you find it isn't positioned 
correctly (e.g. it's floating, clipping the ground or at an odd 
angle), activate the mark select "Adjust". In the adjust menu, 
"/\" and "\/" adjust the height and "<" and ">" adjust the angle. 
Clicking one of these buttons rapidly will adjust by larger 
steps. Click slowly to move by small steps.

When you activate a mark you can also "Rub it out" instead of 
adjusting it.


                         Custom Text

To write your own message, drop the chalk and select the "Custom 
Text" button. You will see a grid with "Your Text Here" written 
in the middle. You can adjust this if it isn't positioned 
correctly. Click "Later" if you need to step back for a better 
look. Once you are satisfied with the placement, click "Write 
Text". You'll get a menu with letter groups (e.g. [A B C D E])
as well as buttons labeled "Space/Other", "Hide", and "Done".

Write your message by selecting a group of letters and then 
picking a specific letter, and repeating. "Space/Other" will 
present you with options to insert a space, start a new line or 
change character sets. Beside the Latin alphabet, you can use 
Daedric letters and "Numbers Etc." which also contains 
punctuation marks. The Hide button hides the menu for a second so 
you can get a better look at what you're writing, and of course 
the Done button closes the menu.
 
                       Writing on Walls

This is a little trickier. There are two ways to do it. Either 
place the chalk at the base of the wall, or stand as close to the 
wall as you can and drop the chalk at your feet (by putting the 
cursor somewhere you can't set it down). In either case, once you 
get the usual menu, click the "Wall" button, at the bottom. The
menu will say "WALL" at the top, and just to make sure you don't
miss it, the menu changes shape as well. As you might have
guessed, clicking the Wall button again will switch back. In wall
mode, most features work the same, but positioning is more
complicated. That's because writing on the wall adds a new
dimension of complexity, literally. Instead of four buttons there
are now six. "/\" and "\/" you will remember, but now we have
"<<", ">>", "><" and "<>" as well. The first two control the
angle, pretty much like "<" and ">" did. But "><" and "<>" are
new. These adjust depth, or how close the mark is to the wall.
"><" pushes text closer to the wall and "<>" pulls it back. If
it's too far it will look like it's floating, and if it's too
close it will either clip the wall or be hidden completely.

Note, if you try to write on a wall that slants back towards you, 
your mark my appear inside the wall. To avoid this, place it a 
little farther back and adjust it afterwards.


                           Options

To see the options menu, "equip" a stick of chalk, that is, drop 
it on your character's portrait. The first three options control 
mark size. Small (1) is half size, Large (3) is double. The 
selected size is indicated by an @ to its left. The next two 
buttons open sub-menus for custom text mode and wall writing 
options. More on these in a moment. Finally, the help button 
gives you a scroll containing the text you are reading right now.


                 Alternate Custom Text Mode

There are two ways to enter custom text. The one already 
described is called "Multi-Level". The other is the "Classic" 
system used in earlier versions. An @ indicates the selected 
mode.

Here's how the Classic method works. You get a menu like this:
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Latin Alphabet: [A] B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N |
|  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z                       |
|                                                           |
|    [<]  [>]  [Add]  [Sp]  [Ln]  [More...]  [Done]  [-]    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
"<" and ">" move the [ ].
"Add" adds the letter currently in [ ].
"Sp" adds a space.
"Ln" starts a new line.
"More..." changes character sets.
"Done" is pretty obvious.
And "-" is like the "Hide" button in the other method.


                        Wall Mode Menu

There are three options here. Height, Angle Snap, and Wall Mode. 
Height is the default height of wall marks. 1.00 is eye-level for 
a male Dark Elf. Use the "/\" and "\/" buttons if you wish to 
adjust it.

Angle Snap will "snap" wall marks to the nearest, 15, 45, or 90 
degrees. Or it can be turned off. The idea is to save you from 
having to adjust the angle manually since many walls are at one 
of these angles. Click the button below the words Angle Snap to 
cycle through these the options.

Wall Mode allows you to write on walls instead of flat surfaces 
by default. The options are "off", "ON", "Save" and "Drop". "Off" 
means flat writing is the default. "ON" mean wall writing is 
default. "Save" means it will remember which you used last. 
"Drop" means it defaults to wall writing if you drop the chalk at 
your feet, and flat writing otherwise. In any case you can always 
use the "Wall" button to switch between wall and flat modes just
before you make a mark. Click the button below the words Wall 
Mode to cycle through these options.


                          Miscellany

A stick of chalk can be used 20 times before it's all gone. You 
can see how many uses are left in a stick of chalk at the top of 
the menu when you equip it or on the menu you get when you drop 
it, the current size appears here as well.

The are three kinds of chalk: white red and glowing. You'll
probably use white chalk most of the time, but red chalk can come
in handy if you need to write on a light colored surface. Glowing
chalk is of course great for use in the dark, but harder to find
(and not present if you didn't load the glow plugin).

     4. Save Games and Compatibility.

*****************************************************************

                            INSTALL

Using an existing save games shouldn't be a problem, unless you
have a pre-3.0 version of this mod. In that case, first, unload
the old version using the directions below. You will lose any
old chalk marks of course. And just to be safe, always start a
new save game when using new plug-ins.

                           UNINSTALL

To uninstall, drop any items you have from this mod (to avoid
the weight bug), and save on a new slot. Unselect this mod
(on the data files list) and load your game. Click through all
the missing object/script/etc errors and save.

The following folders can now be deleted if you wish:
Data Files\Icons\Chalk
Data Files\Meshes\Chalk
Data Files\Textures\Chalk

                            GENERAL

I avoided editing any existing NPCs or containers in stores by
dropping either a few sticks of chalk or a box of it in the store.
The only compatibly problem I can think of for this mod is that
it changes the following leveled lists:

random_pos
random_de_pos
random_com_kitchenware
random_smuggler_1-5
random_smuggler_6-10
random_smuggler_11+
random_bandit_1-5
random_bandit_6-10
random_bandit_11+

The glow plug-in also changes one standard container:
Wizard_chest_01_evil

If you think you have another mod that changes these, you should
use a list merging utility.

*****************************************************************

     5. Known bugs.

*****************************************************************

Lights (torches, lanterns, etc) don't cast light on chalk when
it's first drawn, making it hard to see in some cases. After you
either leave the area and come back, or save and reload, the
chalk will be correctly lit. Sometimes even then, the chalk can
be hard to see because of the way lighting for large objects
like building pieces is calculated.

You can "write on a wall" without a wall...
